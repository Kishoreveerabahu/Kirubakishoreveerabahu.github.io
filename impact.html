    <h1>IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC</h1>
    <p id="art-desc">As of 2021, the COVID‑19 pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV‑2). It's impact has been broad, affecting general society, economy, culture, ecology, politics, and other areas.</p>

    <h2>ECONOMIC IMPACT</h2>
    <p id="para" class="desc text-color">The outbreak of COVID-19 brought economic life to a standstill, which also impacted on sectors, such as aviation, tourism, retail, capital markets and oil. Global unemployment has increased to 23.4%. International and internal mobility is restricted, and the revenues generated by travel and tourism, which contributes 9.2% of the GDP, will take a major toll on the GDP growth rate. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have withdrawn huge amounts from India. Rupee is continuously depreciating. The crisis witnessed a horrifying mass exodus of such floating population of migrants on foot, amidst countrywide lock down. Their worries primarily were loss of job, daily ration, and absence of a social security net.</p>

    <h2>IMPACT ON AGRICULTURE</h2>
    <p class="para-desc">COVID-2019 had an impact on agriculture in two critical respects: availability and demand for food. Some of the harvesting activities are interrupted by the unavailability of migrant labourers, particularly in the northwest zone where wheat and pulses are harvested. Supply chains discontinued due to distribution challenges and safety concerns. Prices for wheat, vegetables, and other commodities had fallen, but customers still spend more. The shutdown of hotels, restaurants, sweet shops and tea shops depresses the dairy sales already.</p>

    <h2>IMPACT ON EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM</h2>
    <p class="para-desc">The reaction to the COVID-19, closure of schools as an immediate measure to avoid infection transmission, was mandated, and the direct home-schooling program was strictly enforced. Although the new schooling is supposed to begin online, closures are likely to deepen the achievement divide among children between low-income and higher-income families. Children from low-income households live in situations that render home education challenging because electronic learning environments typically include computers and a safe internet connection. The quality of education provided online is a sensitive issue that requires mandatory attention.</p>

    <h2>IMPACT ON MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH</h2>
    <p class="para-desc">The level of psychological effects as anxiety, depression, and stress since the start of the epidemic has increased due to the sudden shift in scenario, deaths, and isolation. The pandemic has also affected the healthcare department that is treating the patients suffering from diseases other than corona. Patients with transplants and patients suffering from end-stage organ failure are, particularly at risk. In several nations, elective operations, including live donor transplantation procedures have ceased.</p>
